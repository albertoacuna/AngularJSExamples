# AngularJS Examples - App that shows some of my AngularJS work
This project is here to showcase examples of my AngularJS work.
It is based off of the angular-seed with some modifications.


##Dependencies
Source control should already come with all of the npm and bower dependencies.
If not part of the project you can run

```
  npm install
```

The script will install all npm dependencies as well as bower dependencies.
